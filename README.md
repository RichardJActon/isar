# ISAR

**WARNING alpha software!**

This is a partial reimplementation of [`isa-api`](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api) in R

This implementation may diverge slightly from the [ISA spec](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) whilst it is still under development for our use case.

issue tracking and development take place on the [project repository](https://renkulab.io/projects/hdbi/data-management/isar) on the renkulab.io gitlab instance the github repository is just a mirror and build platform to make use of the existing and well maintained github actions for R packages for testing and distribution.
